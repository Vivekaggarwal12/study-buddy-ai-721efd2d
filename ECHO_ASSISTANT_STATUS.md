## 🎓 How the Fix Works

1. **Setup Detection**: Component checks env vars on load
   - If missing → Shows yellow warning banner
   - If present → Shows green success banner

2. **Error Messages**: When API call fails, message includes:
   - What went wrong (404, 401, etc.)
   - Why it happened (function not deployed, key not set)
   - How to fix it (exact command to run)
   - Next step after fix

3. **Verification Tools**: User can click button to:
   - Open browser console
   - Run `verifyEchoAssistantSetup()`
   - Get detailed diagnostic output
   - Know exactly what to fix

4. **Better UX**: No more mysterious "fetch failed" errors
   - Every error has actionable fix steps
   - Setup status is visible at a glance
   - Clear success indicator when ready

## 🎯 Most Important Takeaway

**If you see:**
```
❌ failing to fetch / CORS error / 404
```

**The fix is (95% of the time):**
```bash
supabase functions deploy echo-assistant
npm run dev
```

Then refresh your browser and try again! 🎉
