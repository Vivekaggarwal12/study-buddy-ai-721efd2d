# Echo Assistant - Complete Troubleshooting Guide

## Error: "Failing to Fetch" - COMPLETE SOLUTION

---

## 🔍 DIAGNOSIS

The "failing to fetch" error happens when:
1. ❌ Backend function isn't deployed
2. ❌ API key isn't set in Supabase
3. ❌ Environment variables missing
4. ❌ Network/CORS issues

---

## ✅ SOLUTION (Follow in Order)

### Phase 1: Check Frontend Setup

**Check 1: Is .env file complete?**
```
Your .env file should have:
✓ VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID
✓ VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY  
✓ VITE_SUPABASE_URL
✓ VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY (optional)
```

**If missing:**
- Find them in Supabase Dashboard
- Add to `.env` file
- Restart: `npm run dev`

---

### Phase 2: Deploy Backend

**Check 2: Is backend function deployed?**

Run:
```bash
supabase functions list
```

You should see:
```
✓ echo-assistant
```

**If NOT deployed:**
```bash
supabase functions deploy echo-assistant
```

**Wait for:**
```
✓ Function deployed successfully
```

---

### Phase 3: Set API Key

**Check 3: Is API key configured?**

Run:
```bash
supabase secrets list
```

You should see `LOVABLE_API_KEY` in the list.

**If NOT set:**

First, get your API key from:
- **Lovable:** Your dashboard
- **Supabase:** Settings → API Keys → Copy "Project API Key"
- **Other service:** Your account settings

Then run:
```bash
supabase secrets set LOVABLE_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

**Wait:** 30 seconds for secrets to propagate

---

### Phase 4: Restart Everything

1. **Stop dev server:** `Ctrl+C`
2. **Clear cache:** Delete `.next` or `dist` folder (if exists)
3. **Restart:** `npm run dev`
4. **Refresh browser:** `Ctrl+Shift+R` (hard refresh)

---

## 🧪 TESTING

### Test 1: Check Console Verification

1. Open Echo Assistant page
2. Look for one of these:

**✅ Success** - Green banner:
```
✅ Setup complete! Echo Assistant is ready.
```

**⚠️ Warning** - Yellow banner with error:
```
Setup Required - Environment variables not configured...
```

**If yellow banner appears:**
- Click "🔍 Run setup verification in console"
- Check browser console (F12)
- Follow the diagnostic output

---

### Test 2: Try Sending a Message

1. Type: "Hello"
2. Click Send
3. Wait 2-3 seconds

**✅ Success:**
- Message appears
- Loading spinner shows
- Response appears from assistant

**❌ Error:**
- You'll see error message
- It will say exactly what to fix

## 🛠️ Advanced Debugging

### Enable Console Logging

Open browser DevTools (F12) → Console, paste:

```javascript
// Run setup verification
import { verifyEchoAssistantSetup } from '@/lib/echoDebugger'
verifyEchoAssistantSetup()
```

Or use the button in the app:
- Click yellow warning banner
- Click "🔍 Run setup verification in console"

### Check Function Logs

```bash
supabase functions logs echo-assistant --tail
```

This shows real-time logs. Look for:
- `ERROR: Cannot find...` → Function issue
- `Missing LOVABLE_API_KEY` → Secret not set
- `CORS error` → Temporary, usually resolves

### Test Endpoint Directly

```bash
curl -X POST \
  'https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/echo-assistant' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY' \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "test"}],
    "topic": "test",
    "language": "en"
  }'
```

Expected response: Either error with details, or streaming response starting with `data: {`
